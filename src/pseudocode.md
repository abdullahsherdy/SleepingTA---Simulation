## The key elements of the problem are

 1. **TA's Office**: The TA's office is rather small and has only one desk with a chair and a computer.
 2. **Waiting Area**: There are three chairs in the hallway outside the TA's office where students can wait if the TA is currently helping another student.
 3. **Student Workflow**:
    - If the TA is available (not helping another student), the student enters the TA's office and receives help.
    - If the TA is currently helping another student, the student waits on one of the chairs in the hallway.
    - If there are no chairs available in the hallway, the student leaves and comes back at a later time.

4. **TA Workflow**:
   - When there are no students who need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap.
   - If a student arrives during this time, the student must wake up the TA to ask for help.

### Pseudocode 
```txt
# Initialize the system
Set number of TAs = Scanner.nextInt()
Set number of chairs = Scanner.nextInt()
Set number of students = Scanner.nextInt()

while true:
    # Check if there are students who need help
    if there are students waiting:
        # Find an available TA
        if there is an available TA:
            # Assign the student to the TA
            Assign a student to the available TA
            Update the number of TAs working
            Update the number of students waiting
        else:
            # No TA available, have the student wait
            Increment the number of students waiting on chairs
            If all chairs are taken:
                Increment the number of students that will come later
    else:
        #  No students waiting, TA can take a nap
        Increment the number of TAs sleeping
        Decrement the number of TAs working

    # Update the GUI
    Update the GUI with the current system state
    Wait for a short period of time (e.g., 1 second) to simulate real-time updates

```

## The key steps in the pseudocode are:

1. Initialize the system with the given number of TAs, chairs, and students.

2. Enter a loop that runs continuously.

3. Check if there are students waiting for help.
    - If there are students waiting, find an available TA to assist them.

    - If a TA is available, assign the student to the TA and update the system state.

4. If no TA is available, have the student wait on a chair if one is available, or increment the number of students that will come later.

5. If there are no students waiting, the TA can take a nap, so increment the number of TAs sleeping and decrement the number of TAs working.

6. Update the GUI with the current system state and wait for a short period of time to simulate real-time updates.
