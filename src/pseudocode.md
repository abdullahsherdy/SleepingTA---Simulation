## The key elements of the problem are

 1. **TA's Office**: The TA's office is rather small and has only one desk with a chair and a computer.
 2. **Waiting Area**: There are three chairs in the hallway outside the TA's office where students can wait if the TA is currently helping another student.
 3. **Student Workflow**:
    - If the TA is available (not helping another student), the student enters the TA's office and receives help.
    - If the TA is currently helping another student, the student waits on one of the chairs in the hallway.
    - If there are no chairs available in the hallway, the student leaves and comes back at a later time.

4. **TA Workflow**:
   - When there are no students who need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap.
   - If a student arrives during this time, the student must wake up the TA to ask for help.
